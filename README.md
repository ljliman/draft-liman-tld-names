# Top-level Domain Name Syntax

**WORK IN PROGRESS!**

This respository revolves around an Internet-Draft (IETF document)
intended to describe the syntactic rules for top-level domains in the
DNS system. It's intended to be published as an RFC. This is very much
work in progress, and the document may not be used in its current form
as an authritative document on the subject.
